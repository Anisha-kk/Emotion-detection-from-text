# Emotion-detection-from-text

This project is done as part of the course "Developing AI Applications using Python and Flask" provided by IBM through Coursera. Here, a text string is taken as input and the scores of different emotions portrayed and the dominant emotion is given as output. The scores are obtained by accessing IBM Watson Embedded AI library functions.
